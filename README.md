# Matching-Under-Constraints-Exploring-the-Deferred-Acceptance-Algorithm
Exploring many-to-one matching problems using the Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA) under constraints like capacity limits, quotas, and budgets. The project also evaluates alternative approaches, such as fair rankings and fixed-point algorithms, to assess their complexity, fairness, and feasibility.
